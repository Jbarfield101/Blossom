# Audio Presets

The **Audio Defaults** section in Settings now supports presets.
Select a preset from the list to apply its BPM, key, and effect
quality toggles. Built-in presets include `default`, `podcast`, and
`lofi`.

To save your own preset:

1. Adjust the audio settings as desired.
2. Enter a name in the *New Preset Name* field.
3. Click **Save Preset**.

Saved presets are stored locally via Zustand persistence and will be
available the next time you open Blossom.
