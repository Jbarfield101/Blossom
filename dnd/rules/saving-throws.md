When a creature faces a spell, trap, or other threat, the DM calls for a saving throw. Roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier and your proficiency bonus if you're proficient in that save. If the total equals or exceeds the Difficulty Class, you resist the effect; otherwise, the danger takes hold.
